# POSMAC: Powering Up In-Network AR/CG Traffic Classification with Online Learning

⚠️**This repository is in state of development**

## POSMAC Introduction

In this demonstration, we showcase **POSMAC**(Platform of Optimization & Deployment of the Online Self-Trainer Model for AR/CG Traffic Classification.), a platform designed to deploy Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) models on the NVIDIA DOCA DPU, equipped with an ARM processor, for real-time network traffic classification. Developed specifically for Augmented Reality (AR) and Cloud Gaming (CG) traffic classification, POSMAC streamlines model evaluation, and generalization while optimizing throughput to closely match line rates. The architecture and components are shown in Fig.1.
